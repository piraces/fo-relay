# Foolay - Forward-only Nostr relay

[![Fly Deploy](https://github.com/piraces/fo-relay/actions/workflows/fly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/piraces/fo-relay/actions/workflows/fly.yml)

This is an attempt to implement a minimal forward-only relay. This means it never actually stores any events, just validates them and passes them on.
